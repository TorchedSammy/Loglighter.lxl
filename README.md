# Loglighter
> ðŸš¦ Highlight logs in the Lite XL log view based on where they come from.

This is a very simple plugin that highlights in the log view with colors based on their name.
That comes from the `[name]` tag at the beginning of the log, for example the LSP logs
in the above screenshot.

# Installation
Simply clone this plugin into your Lite XL plugins folder.
Next, you will have colorful logs!

The code of this plugin is heavily based on the code for the Lite XL log view since
it just recreates it with color, so credit also goes to the Lite XL authors.
